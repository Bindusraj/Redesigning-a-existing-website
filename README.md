3. Navigation and CTAs (“Order Now”, “Gift Card”) were not prominent.
4. Inconsistent font sizing and lack of color variation.

### 📝 **Short Design Improvement Note**

The original café website lacked visual balance, clear hierarchy, and engaging color contrast.
In the redesign, I focused on creating a warm, cohesive layout with strong typography and visible CTAs.
The new design improves readability, usability, and aligns with the café’s modern and cozy aesthetic.

### 📱 **Responsive Concept (Optional)**

A mobile version (375px width) was also designed to ensure all elements stack vertically and remain legible on small screens.
